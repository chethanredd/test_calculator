# calculator-template

A calculator application developed as an assignment for the Software Engineering course. This project demonstrates fundamental software engineering principles including clean code architecture, comprehensive testing, and proper documentation.

## 🚀 Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero)
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: [Specify your language - e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.]
- **Testing Framework**: [Specify framework - e.g., pytest, JUnit, Jest, etc.]
- **Build Tools**: [Specify if applicable - e.g., Maven, npm, etc.]

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Calculator

```bash
# Example command to run the application
# python calculator.py
# java Calculator
# node calculator.js
```

### Basic Operations

The calculator supports the following operations:

- **Addition**: `a + b`
- **Subtraction**: `a - b`
- **Multiplication**: `a * b`
- **Division**: `a / b`

### Example Usage

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15
```

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Example commands for different testing frameworks
# python -m pytest tests/
# mvn test
# npm test
```

### Test Coverage

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Edge cases (division by zero, negative numbers)
- Input validation
- Error handling
